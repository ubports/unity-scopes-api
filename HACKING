-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Before making changes to the code, please read the README file in its entirety!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Building the code
-----------------

By default, the code is built in release mode. To build a debug version, use

    $ mkdir builddebug
    $ cd builddebug
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..
    $ make

For a release version, use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release

Running the tests
-----------------

    $ make
    $ make test

Note that "make test" alone is dangerous because it does not rebuild
any tests if either the library or the test files themselves need
rebuilding. It's not possible to fix this with cmake because cmake cannot
add build dependencies to built-in targets. To make sure that everything
is up-to-date, run "make" before running "make test"!

Some tests are slow. If you want to skip them during development,
you can set the cmake option "slowtests" to OFF.

To run the tests with valgrind:

    $ make valgrind

It doesn't make sense for some tests to run them with valgrind. For
example, the header compilation tests don't need valgrind because
we'd just be testing that Python doesn't leak. There are also some
tests that run too slow and time out under valgrind and, occasionally,
valgrind crashes for a particular test.

There are two ways to suppress tests:

You can add a test name to CTestCustom.cmake.in to suppress that
test completely. That makes sense for the header compilation tests,
for example.

If a specific test case in a test program causes a valgrind problem,
you can selectively disable a section of code like this:

    #include <valgrind/valgrind.h>

    if (!RUNNING_ON_VALGRIND)
    {
        // Code here crashes valgrind...
    }

That way, the test will still be run as part of the normal "make test"
target, but will be ommitted when running "make valgrind".

Coverage
--------

To build with the flags for coverage testing enabled and get coverage:

    $ mkdir buildcoverage
    $ cd buildcoverage
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make coverage

Unfortunately, it is not possible to get 100% coverage for some files,
mainly due to gcc's generation of two destructors for dynamic and non-
dynamic instances. For abstract base classes and for classes that
prevent stack and static allocation, this causes one of the destructors
to be reported as uncovered.

There are also issues with some functions in header files that are
incorrectly reported as uncovered due to inlining, as well as
the impossibility of covering defensive assert(false) statements,
such as an assert in the default branch of a switch, where the
switch is meant to handle all possible cases explicitly.

If you run a binary and get lots of warnings about a "merge mismatch for summaries",
this is caused by having made changes to the source that add or remove code
that was previously run, so the new coverage output cannot sensibly be merged
into the old coverage output. You can get rid of this problem by running

    $ make clean-coverage

This deletes all the .gcda files, allowing the merge to (sometimes) succeed again.
If this doesn't work either, the only remedy is to do a clean build.

If lcov complains about unrecognized lines involving '=====',
you can patch geninfo and gcovr as explained here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcovr/+bug/1086695/comments/2

To run the static C++ checks:

    $ make cppcheck

Code style
----------

We use a format tool that fixes a whole lot of issues
regarding code style. The formatting changes made by
the tool are generally sensible (even though they may not be your
personal preference in all cases). If there is a case where the formatting
really messes things up, consider re-arranging the code to avoid the problem.
The convenience of running the entire code base through the pretty-printer
far outweighs any minor glitches with pretty printing, and it means that
we get consistent code style for free, rather than endlessly having to
watch out for formatting issues during code reviews.

As of clang-format-3.7, you can use

    // clang-format off
    void    unformatted_code  ;
    // clang-format on

to suppress formatting for a section of code.

To format specific files:

    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/tools/formatcode x.cpp x.h

If no arguments are provided, formatcode reads stdin and writes
stdout, so you can easily pipe code into the tool from within an
editor. For example, to reformat the entire file in vi (assuming
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/tools is in your PATH):

    1G!Gformatcode

To re-format all source and header files in the tree:

    $ make formatcode

Thread and address sanitizer
----------------------------

Set SANITIZER to "thread" or "address" to build with the
corresponding sanitizer enabled.

zmq (as 3.2.3 and 4.0.3) causes a large number of warnings from
thread sanitizer. It appears impossible to avoid these; they
are caused by issues in the zmq library. The tsan-suppress file
supresses the benign race conditions we currently know about. To
run the tests (from the build directory) with these suppressions
enabled, use:

    $ TSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=../tsan-suppress" make test

If a test runs too slowly under address sanitizer, you can
hide a section of code from address sanitzer with:

#if defined(__has_feature)
    #if !__has_feature(address_sanitizer)

    // Code here takes forever under address sanitizer...

    #endif
#endif

ABI compatibility
-----------------

Version numbers for both libraries use <major>.<minor>.<micro>.

On Vivid, the soversion for the libraries are a single
integer, such as 3. That integer increments every time
the minor or major version is changed.

On Wily and later, the soversion is of the form <major>.<minor>.

The version numbers for the libraries are generated from files
in the debian directory. (See below for general rules on versioning.)
There are no version numbers defined in any of the MakeLists.txt files.
Instead, to change the version numbers, you must edit the following
files:

  - VERSION

    The full version number for libunity-scopes.

  - QT-VERSION

    The full version number for libunity-scopes-qt.

  - *If* the soname changes, you need to add the outdated
    versions to the "Replaces:" and "Conflicts:" entries
    in control.in. (You need an extra entry for each Vivid and
    Wily/Xenial and later.)
    See bileto_pre_release_hook for the sed scripts that append a
    line to the stanza if the soname is changed. This also may apply
    if the soname of the Qt library changes, in which case
    bileto_pre_release_hook needs a corresponding update.

  - LAST_ABI_ADDITION_VERSION

    The micro version at which we last added something
    new to the libunity-scopes ABI (without breaking anything).

  - LAST_ABI_ADDITION_QT-VERSION

    The micro version at which we last added something
    new to the libunity-scopes-qt ABI (without breaking anything).

  The version files have the format

    <major>.<minor>.<micro>

  All three numbers must be present.

  The soversion for each library is derived from the corresponding
  version file so, unless the soversion changes, you don't need to
  do anything special.

Versioning rules:
    
By definition, if a change is ABI compatible, you must increment
the micro version number. (Without this, we cannot
identify from the version number whether a particular fix
is in this build or not.) The best time to update the micro
version is when creating a silo for landing in the archives.

For changes in behavior that do *not* add anything new to the ABI, you must
increment the micro version in VERSION or QT-VERSION, but *not* the
version in LAST_ABI_ADDITION_VERSION or LAST_ABI_ADDITION_QT-VERSION.
For changes that add something to the ABI (without breaking it), you *must*
increment *both* VERSION and LAST_ABI_ADDITION_VERSION (or
QT-VERSION and LAST_ABI_ADDITION_QT-VERSION).

For ABI incompatible changes, either minor or major must be
incremented, and the lower-order version numbers must be reset to zero.

A change in major version number is meant to indicate major official releases.
What is "major" or "official" is somewhat arbitrary; unless we
are about to release a new Ubuntu version or there are major
feature changes in the scopes run time or API, incrementing
the minor version number is sufficient.

The .so version for the library is <major>.<minor>. For example,
version 1.3.1 has the name libunity-scopes.so.1.3. (On Vivid only,
for libunity-scopes.so only, the .so version is a single integer,
such as libunity-scopes.so.3. (It is derived from the minor version
number.)

When incrementing the minor or major version number, follow these steps:

1) Edit one or more of the version files, control, and control.in as
   described above. Also verify that debian/bileto_pre_release_hook correctly
   updates the "Replaces:" and "Conflicts:" entries.

2) Add an entry to debian/changelog with the new version number (for Wily).

3) Update RELEASE_NOTES.md

4) Add new ABI baseline files to test/abi-compliance/abi_dumps (see below).

ABI compliance test
-------------------

The tests include an ABI compliance test (for xenial and later). To run it:

    $ cd test/abi-compliance
    $ make test

The test is also automatically run as part of the test suite.
It takes a while to run. If you don't want to wait during local builds,
set the cmake "slowtests" option to OFF to skip the check.

The baseline ABI files for the test are in test/abi-compliance/abi_dumps.
There is a separate directory for each architecture.
The ABI dump files should never be updated or removed.
Instead, when the ABI changes, you need to add a new baseline
ABI file for each architecture. The easiest way to generate
these files is to make a branch with a modified install file
that installs the ABI dump in, say, /usr/lib. Then throw
the branch at a silo to get it built for all architectures.
Once all the packages are built, you can extract the ABI dump
files and add them to the corresponding directory in the source tree.

The abi compliance test produces a report in
libunity-scopes_<current-version>_abi-report.txt if anything unusual is detected.

Autopkg test suite
------------------

Scopes come with an autopkg smoke test.

http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/auto-pkg-test.html

Running the test manually is simple. After building and installing the
new packages, just run 'sh debian/tests/scopebuild'.

To run the autopkg tests the same way Jenkins does, without installing
the packages, follow the instructions here:

http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/auto-pkg-test.html

When adding new tests to debian/tests, be sure that the new tests
are built and run by adding them to tests/autopkg. Doing this doesn't
run the tests exactly the same way as on Jenkins because they will
be built and run against the headers and library in the build area,
rather than against the installed packages. But it provides a basic
sanity check for them. Without this, it's very easy to make a breaking
change to the API and forgetting to update the autopkg tests too,
meaning that the failure will show up only in Jenkins, but not
when running the tests locally.
