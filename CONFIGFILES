This document outlines how the scopes run time is configured.
In general, if a recognized key is not set in a configuration
file, a default value applies as detailed below.

The following configuration files are used by the scopes run time:


Runtime.ini
-----------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Runtime.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Runtime].

The following keys are recognized:

- Registry.Identity (string)

  The identity of the local registry. If not set, the default value is "Registry".
  To run a scope without a registry, for example, using the scoperunner for testing, the identity
  can be the empty string.

- Registry.ConfigFile (string)

  The path to the registry configuration file. The default value is
  "/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Registry.ini".

- Default.Middleware (string)

  The middleware to be used by default. The default value is "Zmq".

- <middleware>.ConfigFile

  The path to the configuration file for the middleware, with the value of
  Default.Middleware substituted for <middleware>, For example,

  Zmq.ConfigFile = <path>

  The default value is "/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Zmq.ini".

- Reap.Expiry

  A ReplyBase instance receives push() invocations from a scope in
  response to a query.
  If a scope becomes non-responsive and stops pushing, eventually,
  the scopes run time calls the finished() method with an error indicating
  that there was no activity for some time and then deallocates the
  ReplyBase instance.

  Reap.Expiry sets the inactivity time (in seconds) for a query to be
  considered "dead". If no push() or finished() message arrives for
  this amount of time, the scopes run time reaps the ReplyBase.

  The default value is 45 seconds.

- Reap.Interval

  The run time maintains a reaper thread that checks for "dead"
  queries (at most) every Reap.Interval seconds. For a Reap.Expiry
  time of 45 seconds and a Reap.Interval of 10 seconds, the actual
  time for a dead query to be reaped is at least 45 seconds and
  at most 55 seconds.

  The default value is 10 seconds.

- CacheDir

  The parent directory under which a scope can write scope-specific data files
  (such as caches).

  The default value is $HOME/.local/share/unity-scopes.

  Note that the actual files are written into subdirectories of
  this directory, for example:

  $HOME/.local/share/unity-scopes/leaf-net/<scope_id>/some_file (for confined scopes)
  and $HOME/.local/share/unity-scopes/unconfined/<scope_id>/some_file (for unconfined scopes).

- AppDir

  The parent directory under which a scope can read data provided by an
  app that was installed from the same click package.

  The default value is $HOME/.local/share.

  Note that the actual directory is a subdirectory of
  this directory, for example:

  $HOME/.local/share/<app-pkgname>

  The app has read/write permission for this directory and the files in it,
  the scope has read-only permission, so communication is from the app to
  the scope, not vice versa.

- ConfigDir

  The parent directory under which the run time writes the scope configuration files.

  The default value is $HOME/.cache/unity-scopes.

  The environment variable UNITY_SCOPES_CONFIG_DIR overrides this key (useful when running
  automated tests that should not overwrite any of the real configuration files).

- Log.TraceChannels

  The names of channels for which to emit trace. This must be a semicolon-separated
  list of channel names. By default, tracing for all channels is disabled.
  Valid channel names are:

  - IPC

    Trace inter-process messages activity.

  The environment variable UNITY_SCOPES_LOG_TRACECHANNELS overrides this key.
  The value must be a semicolon-separated list of channel names.


Zmq.ini
-------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Zmq.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values for keys apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Zmq].

The following keys are recognized:

- EndpointDir (string)

  The directory in which the public endpoint of a scope (or the registry) is created.
  This endpoint must be accessible to any process.

  The default value is "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zmq". If XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not
  set, or $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR does not exist or is not writable, initialization fails.

  Otherwise, the public directory is created if it does not exist, with mode rwxr-xr-xt.

  Private endpoints are created in "<EndpointDir>/priv". The priv
  directory is created if it does not exist, with mode rwx------t.

- Registry.EndpointDir

  The directory in which the public endpoints of the registry are created.
  If set to a non-empty string, this directory overrides the setting
  of EndpointDir for the registry only. (This is provided for testing,
  so a separate registry can run beside the system-wide registry.)

  The directory is created if it does not exist, with mode rwxr-xr-xt.

- Default.Twoway.Timeout

  The default timeout value to be used for twoway invocations in milliseconds.
  If a twoway invocation (such as list() or search()) does not complete
  within the specified time, the invocation throws a TimeoutException, possibly
  after asking the registry to start the target process first (see Locate.Timeout).

  The default value is 500 milliseconds.

- Smartscopes.Registry.EndpointDir

  The directory in which the public endpoints of the registry are created.
  If set to a non-empty string, this directory overrides the setting
  of EndpointDir for the registry only. (This is provided for testing,
  so a separate registry can run beside the system-wide registry,
  while still using the system-wide smartscopes registry.)

- Locate.Timeout

  The timeout to be used when asking the registry to start a scope. If the registry
  does not respond within the specified amount of time, the scope is assumed
  to be unavailable, and twoway invocations fail with a TimeoutException.

  Note that this value must be somewhat larger than the value of Process.Timeout
  in Registry.ini, otherwise invocations on a scope that needs to be activated
  first can fail, even though the activation succeeded.

  Only values in the range 10 to 60000 milliseconds are accepted. (Values outside
  this range would either cause locate() to falsely conclude that a scope
  could not be started, or cause an unacceptably long wait time.)

  Only values in the range 10 to 60000 milliseconds are accepted.

  The default value is 5000 milliseconds.

- Registry.Timeout

  The timeout to be used when invoking a twoway operation on the registry other
  than locate().

  Only values in the range 10 to 60000 milliseconds are accepted.

  The default value is 5000 milliseconds.

- ChildScopes.Timeout

  The timeout to be used when invoking either child_scopes() or set_child_scopes()
  on a scope. These methods require more time to execute than other scope methods
  as they read from and write to disk.

  Only values in the range 10 to 60000 milliseconds are accepted.

  The default value is 2000 milliseconds.


Registry.ini
------------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Registry.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values for keys apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Registry].

The following keys are recognized:

- Middleware

  The middleware used by the registry, such as "Zmq". The default value is "Zmq".

- <Middleware>.ConfigFile

  <Middleware> must match the value of the Middleware key, for example:

      Zmq.Middleware = path/to/SomeFile.ini

- Scoperunner.Path

  The path to the scoperunner executable. The path must be an absolute path.
  The default value is "/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/scoperunner".

- Scope.InstallDir

  The directory in which to look for subdirectories containing scope .so and .ini files.

  The default value is "/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes".

- OEM.InstallDir

  The directory in which to look for subdirectories containing scope .so and .ini files added
  by OEMs. The default value is "/custom/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes".

- Click.InstallDir

  The directory in which to look for subdirectories containing scopes installed from click packages.

  The default value is "$HOME/.local/share/unity-scopes".

- Process.Timeout

  This parameter determines how long the registry will wait for a scope
  to start and stop. The registry waits for at most Process.Timeout
  milliseconds before it concludes that a scope failed to initialize
  or terminate correctly. If a scope does not respond
  within the allotted time, it is killed with SIGKILL.

  Only values in the range 10 to 60000 milliseconds are accepted.

  The default value is 4000 milliseconds.

  Note that this value must be less than Locate.Timeout in the [<Middleware>]
  config group, otherwise the middleware can prematurely conclude that
  a locate() request failed to start a scope.


Smartscopes.ini
--------------

If no specific file is provided to the scopes run time, the default path is
"/usr/lib/<arch>/unity-scopes/Smartscopes.ini".

If that file does not exist, the default values for keys apply.

The only recognized group in this file is [Smartscopes].

The following keys are recognized:

- Http.Reply.Timeout

  The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a reply from the smartscopes server.
  The value must be in the range 1 - 60.

  The default value is 20 seconds.

- Registry.Refresh.Rate

  The amount of time (in seconds) between metadata refreshes from the smartscopes server.
  The value must be >= 60.

  The default value is 24 hours.

- Registry.Refresh.Fail.Timeout

  The amount of time (in seconds) in between retry attempts if a metadata refresh from
  the smartscopes server fails.
  The value must be >= 1.

  The default value is 10 seconds.

- Scope.Identity

  The identity for proxy scope provided by smartscopesproxy.

  The default value is "SmartScope".


<scope_id>.ini
--------------

NOTE: Only undocumented and deprecated keys are listed here.
      See tutorial.dox for the "official" list of keys.

The recognized groups in this file are:

- ScopeConfig
- Appearance

The following keys are recognized in the ScopeConfig group:

- Override (undocumented)

  Determines whether an OEM scope is allowed to override a Canonical scope. This key is used only by Canonical
  scopes. If true, the Canonical scope can be replaced by an OEM scope with the same ID. The default value
  is false.

  For OEM scopes and click scopes, the setting of this key is ignored.

- HotKey (undocumented, currently unused)

  The hot key for the scope. The default value is the empty string.

- ChildScopes (deprecated)

  The list of ids of scopes aggregated by this scope (if any). The values in this list
  must be separated by semicolons. This list is translated to the names of
  children scopes when in the scopes overview page of the Unity Dash.

  Note: make sure there are no trailing spaces following
  the ids, as they will be preserved.

  This option is deprecated, please reimplement ScopeBase::find_child_scopes() instead.

- Invisible (undocumented)

  Whether the scope is hidden in the UI. The default value is false.

- DebugMode (undocumented)

  Disables a bunch of timeouts when debugging a scope with the SDK.
  Default value is false.

The following keys are recognized in the Appearance group:

- see tutorial.dox
